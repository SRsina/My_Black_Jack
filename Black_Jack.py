  ############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

  ## The deck is unlimited in size. 
  ## There are no jokers. 
  ## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
  ## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
  ## The cards have equal probability of being drawn.
  ## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
  ## The computer is the dealer.
  ## If dealer has a score of 17 or less, they must draw another card.
  ## Ace for dealer is counted 11 always.
  ## If you have double Ace, even you want to count it as 1, it will be counted as 11 and the final score is 21 (for 2 Aces).
